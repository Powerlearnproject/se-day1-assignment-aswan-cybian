Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software  engineering  is  the systematic  application  of engineering  principles  to Software  development 
Important  of Software 
Ensuring  Software  reliability, scalability  and maintenance 
Improving  efficiency  and  reducing  development  costs  through  structured methodologies 
enhancing  security  and compliance in Software  application. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1990s present:Agile  and DevOps  evolution-Agile  methodologies  revolutionised  development  with  iterative  and flexibility  approaches, while  DevOps  integrated  development  and operations  for faster  delivery  and deployment 
1970s- Introduction  of structured  programming    concepts  like modules programming  and object  oriented  design  emerged  to improve  code reliability  and maintenance 
1950s- Birth of Software  engineering  Early  programming  practice  were informal ,leading  to the  first  Software  crisis,  highlighting  the need for structured  development  and methodologies. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements-gatherings  and analysing  user needs
2.Planning -Defining scope  timelines, and  resources 
3.Design -creating  system  architecture and  specification 
4.mplemations- writing  and integrating  codes
5.Testing -Identify  and fixing  defect 
6.Deployment -Releasing  the Software  to user
7.Mantainance - providing  updates  and fixing  issues  post - release
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriatdevelopment 
Waterfall- Alinear ,sequential  approach where  each phase  must be  completed  before  moving  to the  next .Suitable  for projects  with clear ,stable  Requirements 
Agile- An iterative  approach  with  continuous  feedback  and adaptability  Suitable  for dynamic  environment  where  requirements  evolve

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software  developer- Write and maintains  codes  implements  features, and debug  software 
Quality  Assurance Engineer- Design  test cases ,ensures  Software  quality and identifies  detects
Project  Manager- Oversees  project  timelines, Coordinates team  ,and ensures  project  goals are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give 
examples of each.
Integrated  Development  Environment- provides tool for coding  debugging, and testing in single  platform
Version  Control  Systems  -Enables  tracking  and managing  codes  changes  across  team.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with  new technologies-contious  learning  through  course and practice
Managing  projects deadlines-Using Agile  methodologies  and task priotritizatins 
Debugging complex issues- Leveranging  Debugging  tools  and peer codes review. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Testing  individual  components. 
Integration  Testings  -Ensuring  modules  work together 
System Testing  Verifying  overall  system  behaviour 
Acceptance Testing- Validating  software  meets  business  needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It nvolves designing  effective  queries  to omptimize Al models  response .It enhances AI interaction by providing  clarity ,specifically, and relevance, making AI -generater outputs  more useful.
M

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
